# Microsoft_AlgorithmsDataStructures
Repository for my solutions to Microsoft Algorithms Data Structures course on edX. Solutions were developed using Linux and Dotnetcore.

To build/run the solutions you will need the following:
* Dotnet Core 2.1.4 or greater which can be found [here](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download)
* Once Dotnet Core is installed you can build the solution using the commands `dotnet restore` and `dotnet build`
* You can run the solutions using `dotnet run`

You may also import the projects into Visual Studio assuming you have Dot Net core setup and run them from within Visual Studio.
